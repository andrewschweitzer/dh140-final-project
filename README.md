Donald Trump’s frequent Twitter usage, both during and after his presidency, raises the questions: How did the sentiment of Trump’s tweets impact public opinion? How has the sentiment of Trump’s tweets changed over time, and are there any common themes associated with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments?

This study aims to examine and analyze Donald Trump’s tweets since 2016 to answer these questions. We will explore the trends and shifts in sentiment of Trump’s tweets throughout his presidency and analyze the public’s reaction. We will also look for topics or themes that are frequently associated with positive, negative, or neutral sentiment in Trump’s tweets through text analysis. This project seeks to provide insights into Trump’s use of Twitter and how it might influence the future political landscape.
